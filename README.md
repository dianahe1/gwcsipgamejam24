# Vitality Run | Game Jam Project
Made during my time as a TA for the 2024 Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program!

## Introduction
To match the theme of "what hope means to me", I chose to create a game where the idea of hope is represented through improving one's health. To me, my personal health is a continuous source of motivation. Many times, when I feel anxious or stressed out, actions like eating something healthy & fulfilling, going on a bike ride, or spending some time exercising are a fundamental force that restores my energy and confidence.

## Project Overview
This platform game allows the user to use the arrow keys to move up, down, forward, and backward to navigate the setting. There are five levels in total, each corresponding to a different need that the user must fulfill in order to reach the end.

The intensity of these needs is based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs to some extent, as the user must first collect basic supplies like food and water before moving on to self-actualization.
